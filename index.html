      AP, Or action point is a system built into your personal Pit Boy. I would recommend on your V.A.T.S.(Vault-Tec Assisted Targeting System) his will allow your attacks to be more accurate. The further along you survive the more action points you will be able to earn. And dont forget always upgrade your weapons, it only gets harder from here on out!
